### SEO (Search Engine Optimization)

Meta Tags: Meta tags implemented using next-seo library for generating meta tags.
Structured Data: structured data for schema.org markup to improve SEO implemented using schema-dts library.

### Performance

Server-Side Rendering (SSR): Next.js automatically handles SSR for pages, which significantly improves initial load times.
Automatic Code Splitting: Next.js automatically splits code into smaller bundles, reducing initial load times.
Minification: Next.js automatically minifies JavaScript and CSS during production builds, reducing file sizes
Dynamic imports: improves performance by reducing initial load times and making code more modular.
